6) geo location stuff - Maybe
10) pull in latest yawnlog tweet
11) can't friend yourself 
12) add data export
14) dream tagging
15) big numbers showing sleep interval

16) sleep_chart_url() should return an escaped link (for HTML validation) 
17) time zone support
18) user profile fields for gender, city, country and rename zip postal code (on the front end at least)
19) iPhone interface
20) make the time of day swap customizable for the charts.

Bugs:
sometimes the sleep validation seems to not be correct
the error messages are not helpful to users
average sleep last night kills everything really bad. might be better to just query sleep from last night and use users.count
